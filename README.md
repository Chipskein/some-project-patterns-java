# Some Project Patterns in Java

This repository contains various software design patterns implemented in Java. It is a learning-focused collection of practical examples that demonstrate the structure and usage of commonly used patterns in object-oriented software design.

Each package contains:

- Java classes that represent the pattern implementation
- A `Main` class to demonstrate how to use the pattern

## 📌 Implemented Patterns

### ✅ Creational Patterns

- Builder
- Prototype

### ✅ Structural Patterns

- Adapter
- Decorator
- Facade
- Proxy

### ✅ Behavioral Patterns

- Command
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method

## 🛠 Requirements

- Java 17+
- Maven or your preferred build tool

## ▶️ How to Run

To run an example pattern:

1. Navigate to the specific pattern package.
2. Run the `Main.java` (or similarly named) file.

Example (with Maven):

```bash
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="pattern.apresentacao.Main"
